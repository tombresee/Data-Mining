------
Images
------

Add an image with:

.. image:: screenshots/file.png
   :height: 100
   :width: 200
   :alt: alternate text



You can inline an image or other directive with the |customsub| command.


.. |customsub| image:: image/image.png
              :alt: (missing image text)

Lists
-----

- Bullet are made like this
- Point levels must be consistent
    * Sub-bullets
        + Sub-sub-bullets
- Lists

Term
    Definition for term
Term2
    Definition for term 2

:List of Things:
    item1 - these are 'field lists' not bulleted lists
    item2
    item 3

:Something: single item
:Someitem: single item
:Someitem: t mon

-----------------
Preformatted text
-----------------

A code example prefix must always end with double colon like it's presenting something::

 ord()
     ord('H')
     8 bits of memory = byte
     ord():  what is the numeric value of a simple ASCII character 
     print(ord('H'))


 unicode


 UTF-8
     variable length




 a


Now we're out of the preformatted block.

There are three equivalents: ``code``, ``sourcecode``, and ``code-block``.

Links
-----

Web addresses by themselves will auto link, like this: https://www.devdungeon.com

You can also inline custom links: `Google search engine <https://www.google.com>`_

This is a simple link_ to Google with the link defined separately.

.. _link: https://www.google.com

This is a link to the `Python website`_.

.. _Python website: http://www.python.org/

This is a link back to `Section 1`_. You can link based off of the heading name
within a document.
